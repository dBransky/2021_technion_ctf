I always thought mixing things is fun, what do you think?  
we are presented with the follwing text:  
**9 92 14 8 7 75 89 22 8 7 9 8 104 57 64 53 21 8 23 68 39**
i tried deciphering the code directly with no success, when i found this online tool of known cipher detection:  
https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier  
get get a hit for periodic table cipher and the solution is:  
**cstechnion{fusion_reaction_for_flag_discovery}**
