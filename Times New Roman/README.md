**Times New Roman**  
**89**  
I found this code in one of the learning center in the Technion, can you figure out what it is?  
  
Note: the flag is all lowercase  
we are represented with the following cipher:  
**👍💧❄☜👍☟☠✋⚐☠❀❄☟☜♉☝✌💧❄☜☼♉👍☜☠❄☜☼♉✋💧♉❄☟☜♉👌☜💧❄♉☝✌💧❄☜☼❝**
again after googling the symbols we find this is WD Gaster font and find the flag:  
**cstechnion{the_gaster_center_is_the_best_gaster}**
